# Lessons Learned:
How to better structure an application with multiple pages and routes. Organization was important during the build of this project. I brainstormed how the wireframe was going to be on the backend and thought of the main key features I wanted to create. implementing the friends feature and feed was challenging but I learned how to work with multiple collections from a database.
